# JeongAh Jo Joo

## Major: Neuroscience

*Graduating with Honors*

I just wanted to give a huge thanks to my family, friends and faculty at Lyman Briggs who have supported me and cared for me all this way. You have helped me get back up every time I fell and breathed courage into me to never doubt myself and never fear failure. Thank you for everything you've done for me, I am eternally grateful.
