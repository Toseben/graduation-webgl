Thank you to my family, friends, and fellow REHS members who have supported me the last 4 years. I love you all so much. I could not imagine not being a part of this incredible residential college with professors like Dr. Ward, Dr. Parks, Hanni, Dr. Cass and so many others. I thank you all so much for standing by me and helping me achieve greatness.
